				We can not continue treating our models as black boxes anymore. Remember, nobody trusts computers for making a very important decision (yet!). That&#39;s why the interpretation of  Machine Learning models has become a major research topic. SHAP is a very robust approach for providing interpretability to any machine learning model.  For multi-classification problems, however, documentation and examples are not very clear. [8min read]

				Jupyter and Rstudio notebooks have become the default standard for data science development. However, it is important to know their limitations and detect the moment of moving to a more &#34;powerful&#34; tool. Since in data science a very significant portion of the work is related to  development, it is always important to be aware of the last development tools.
