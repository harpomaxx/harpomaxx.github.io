				Notebooks rule! We agree on that, but they can get messy very fast. The truth is  they are not the best tool for good software engineering practices. Data Version Control (DVC) is a toolset for helping the development of machine learning experiments favoring better practices. Are you ready to give it a try? [5min read]

				Jupyter and Rstudio notebooks have become the default standard for data science development. However, it is important to know their limitations and detect the moment of moving to a more &#34;powerful&#34; tool. Since in data science a very significant portion of the work is related to  development, it is always important to be aware of the last development tools.
