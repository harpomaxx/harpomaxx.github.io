<p>The current post is the second part of a series of posts discussing the more relevant aspects of using DVC. See the first post <a href="/post/dvc-intro-part-why/">here</a>. The current post is centered around the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R language</a> since there are many other interesting (and probably better) posts using python 🤷.</p>
<div id="revisiting-the-general-idea-behind-dvc" class="section level2">
<h2>Revisiting the general idea behind DVC</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned in the first post of the series, one of the issues tackled by DVC is <strong>how to keep track of your whole machine learning pipeline.</strong> DVC aims to track the data, code, configuration parameters, and resulting models. As you can see from the picture below (gently stolen from DVC ), DVC creates references to all the resources (i.e. code, datasets, and models) involved in the current pipeline. So, with DVC you have a sort of <em>snapshot</em> of the code, datasets, configuration parameters, and models.</p>
<blockquote>

</div>
<div id="a-workflow-for-migrating-to-dvc-pipelines" class="section level2">
<h2>A workflow for migrating to DVC Pipelines</h2>
<p>The following are just some notes about the process I personally use to migrate from notebooks to DVC. Nowadays, the first approach to tackling a problem is still notebook-based, but after a couple of hours in the project, I start migrating to DVC.</p>
<div id="use-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Use functions</h3>
<p>Yes, I know it could be pretty obvious, but it is incredible to see how often you finish your experimental research with several notebooks and without one piece of code inside a function definition. Writing and thinking about functions should be the default when you are working on a data science project. ( <em>Sure, you can go further with OOP and other fancy approaches, but for me at least, OOP provides too much overhead for a simple data science experimental setup</em> 🤷. )</p>
<p>I recommend the R package approach: <strong>one function per file.</strong> (even if you are not using R). In general, the idea is to have a limited number of functions included in a file. The latter will simplify your life when following a <strong>Git Collaboration workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Using functions provide you with versatility. You can refactor your notebook with functions and continue using it for performing fast analysis, EDAs, or whatever you want it to do. <em>The same function</em> can be included in a DVC script that is part of your Machine Learning pipeline. <em>The same function</em> can be included in your REST service using a <a href="https://www.rplumber.io/">plumber</a> ( See my <a href="https://harpomaxx.github.io/post/deploying-ml-model/">post</a> about it).</p>
<p>In a previous post, I discussed a possible directory structure for keeping your experiment tidy. I will include it below for simplicity (Feel free to change whatever you want in this structure)</p>
<p><img src="https://harpomaxx.github.io/post/github-workflow-in-research/images/Screenshot_2021-11-20_19-45-38.png" /></p>
<figcaption>
<h6>
Figure 3: A possible directory structure of a git repository for machine learning research experiments
</h6>
</figcaption>
<p>The <code>code/</code> directory contains all the code for running the experiment. As you can see in the image below, inside the <code>R/</code> directory there are other directories including the <code>functions/</code>. The same approach applies if you use Python but under the <code>python/</code> directory ( Duh !! ). Inside this directory, you should include all the functions extracted from your notebooks. In the example below, I have created functions for feature selection, training models, and SHAP value analysis, among others.</p>
<p><img src="/img/dvc-code-tree-example.png" width="500" /></p>
<figcaption>
<h6>
Figure 4: An example of file distribution inside the <code>code/</code> directory
</h6>
</figcaption>
<p>Let’s define a simple function that selects the initial set of features for a given dataset. The function receives two parameters, the dataset and a list of the selected features.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
#&#39; select initial features based on disciplinary knowledge
#&#39; @param dataset 
#&#39; @param initial_features
#&#39; @return dataset with selected features

select_initial_features &lt;- function(dataset, initial_features){
  dataset$Anim &lt;- as.factor(dataset$Anim)
  dataset_numeric &lt;- dataset %&gt;% 
    select(all_of(initial_features))
  dataset_numeric %&gt;% 
    tibble::add_column(Activity=as.factor(dataset$Activity))
  }</code></pre>
<p>Now, for using DVC, you need to transform this function into an executable script. Executable scripts are the base of the DVC pipelines. The file <code>020_select_features_initial_cmd.R</code> located inside the <code>scripts/</code> directory is the actual executable used by DVC. In a brief, the basic idea of the script is to read a dataset, a set of initial features, and invoke the <code>select_initial_features()</code> function defined above.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="executable-scripts-are-the-base-of-the-dvc-pipelines." style="color:gray;text-align: left">Executable scripts are the base of the DVC pipelines.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>The code below is part of the <code>020_select_features_initial_cmd.R</code> executable script. The idea is to run the script via <code>Rscript</code> or <code>r</code> frontend. As you can see, one of the first line of the script source the file containing the <code>select_initial_features()</code> function. Then, in the next lines, we use the <code>optparse</code> package for managing arguments for the scripts (If you never have used the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optparse/index.html">package</a> before, I highly recommend it. It is simple and does the job)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#!/bin/Rscript
# Select initial features
source(&quot;code/R/functions/select_features_initial.R&quot;)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(optparse))
suppressWarnings(
  suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(yaml)))
option_list &lt;- list(
  make_option(&quot;--input&quot;, 
              action=&quot;store&quot;, 
              type=&quot;character&quot;, 
              help = &quot;Set the name of the input data file in tsv format&quot;),
  make_option(&quot;--output&quot;, 
              action=&quot;store&quot;, 
              type=&quot;character&quot;, 
              default=&quot;&quot;, 
              help = &quot;Set the name of the output data file in tsv format&quot;)
)
opt &lt;- parse_args(OptionParser(option_list=option_list))
## Check for arguments
if (opt$input %&gt;% is.null() || 
    opt$output %&gt;% is.null()){
  message(&quot;[] Parameters missing. 
          Please use --help for look at available arguments&quot;)
  quit()
}else{
  # Read dataset
  dataset &lt;- 
    readr::read_delim(opt$input, 
                      col_types = cols(), 
                      delim = &#39;\t&#39;)
  ## Select features
  dataset &lt;- 
    select_initial_features(dataset, 
                            INITIAL_FEATURES)
  ## Save dataset
  dir.create(dirname(opt$output), 
             showWarnings = FALSE)
  readr::write_delim(dataset, 
                     file = opt$output, 
                     delim = &#39;\t&#39;)
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, I have defined only 2 arguments: <code>--input</code> and <code>--output</code> . The first argument refers to the original dataset (delimited with tabular), while the second refers to the resulting dataset with just the selected features included. The script has four sections: <em>a) check for parameters, b) read dataset, c) select features, and d) save the resulting dataset.</em></p>
<p>You can, then, invoke the script from the project base directory as follows:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>bash$ Rscript code/R/scripts/020_select_features_initial_cmd.R \
--input rawdata/preprocessed.tsv \
--output data/initial_features/preprocessed-initial-features.tsv</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>--output</code> argument will create a <code>initial_features/</code> directory under <code>data/</code> thanks to the <code>dir.create()</code> function.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-stages" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating stages</h3>
<p>Following DVC nomenclature, a <em>stage</em> is a task part of a machine learning process. A machine learning pipeline is defined by several of these stages. If you look at Figure 2, you will find that several nodes of the graph correspond to DVC stages.</p>
<p>DVC uses a file named <code>dvc.yaml</code> for defining a machine learning pipeline. The <code>dvc.yaml</code> is a file in <a href="https://yaml.org/"><code>YAML</code></a> format that defines different aspects such as results and dependencies of a machine learning project. I don’t want to reformulate the explanation behind <code>dvc.yaml</code> the file (you can check <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/start/data-management/pipelines">here</a> for that), instead, I will start with an example.</p>
<p>So, let’s include the script inside the DVC <code>dvc.yaml</code> file. I will define a new stage named <code>select_features_initial</code> for executing the script.</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>stages:
    select_features_initial:
    cmd: Rscript code/R/scripts/020_select_features_initial_cmd.R 
    --input rawdata/preprocessed.tsv
    --output data/initial_features/preprocessed-initial-features.tsv
    
    deps:
    - code/R/functions/select_features_initial.R
    - code/R/scripts/020_select_features_initial_cmd.R
    - rawdata/preprocessed.tsv
    
    outs:
    - data/initial_features</code></pre>
<p>The <code>cmd:</code> node defines the script and arguments to be executed during the stage. A second node <code>deps:</code> is used for defining the dependencies of the stage. In this case, I have defined three dependencies: the input dataset, the function, and the script itself.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>outs:</code> node indicates the directory location where the resulting dataset will be left.</p>
<p><strong>But WAIT ! !,</strong> the INITIAL_FEATURES variable is undefined. We have not provided any definition for it. I will use this terrible mistake as an excuse to introduce DVC parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="tracking-parameters" class="section level3">
<h3>Tracking parameters</h3>
<p>The INITIAL_FEATURES variable should be defined somewhere. But ideally, you would like to execute an experiment with different initial variable sets. For that, DVC provides the <code>params.yaml</code> file. There you can define parameters associated with a particular stage and every time the parameters change, DVC will re-execute only the dependent stages.</p>
<p>For this particular example the <code>params.yaml</code> would like like this</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>select_initial:
  features:
  - Anim
  - Standing
  - Active
  - Lying
  - DFL1
  - DFL2
  - DFL3
  - DFA12
  - DFA123
  - DBL1
  - DBL2
  - DBL3
  - DBA12
  - DBA123</code></pre>
<p>The first YAML node is the name associated with the <em>select_features_initial</em> stage. Notice that it is not necessary to match. You can pick whatever name you want. Then, the node <code>features</code> is a collection with the names of the selected features.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, manipulating the information provided inside <code>params.yaml</code> is your responsibility. In other words, you should read and parse the corresponding parameters inside the <code>020_select_features_initial_cmd.R</code> file.</p>
<p>The good news is that in R you can use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaml/index.html"><code>yaml</code></a> package for reading and writing YAML files. It is actually pretty simple.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  ## Set default parameters
  params &lt;- yaml::read_yaml(&quot;params.yaml&quot;)
  if(!  &quot;select_initial&quot; %in% names(params)) {
    message(&quot;[] Error: No information for selecting features.&quot;)
    quit() }</code></pre>
<p>The snippet below just load the <code>params.yaml</code> file and check for the <code>select_initial</code> node. If everything went OK, then you can access the <code>features</code> node using</p>
<pre><code>&gt; params$select_initial$features
 [1] &quot;Anim&quot; &quot;Standing&quot;  &quot;Active&quot; &quot;Lying&quot;  &quot;DFL1&quot;  &quot;DFL2&quot;  &quot;DFL3&quot;  &quot;DFA12&quot;
 ....</code></pre>
<p>So, now you can invoke the function with the corresponding variable</p>
<pre class="r"><code> dataset &lt;- select_initial_features(dataset,params$select_initial$features)</code></pre>
<p>The last is to inform DVC about the parameters. By doing this, DVC will be updating the dependency graph with the node <code>select_initial</code> located inside <code>params.yaml.</code> So, you need to add into <code>dvc.yaml</code> the following line in the <code>select_initial_features</code> node. I will post the complete stage section for completeness.</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code> stages:
    select_features_initial:
    cmd: Rscript code/R/scripts/020_select_features_initial_cmd.R 
    --input rawdata/preprocessed.tsv
    --output data/initial_features/preprocessed-initial-features.tsv
    deps:
    - code/R/functions/select_features_initial.R
    - code/R/scripts/020_select_features_initial_cmd.R
    - rawdata/preprocessed.tsv
    outs:
    - data/initial_features
    params:
    - select_initial.features</code></pre>
<p>Well, now everything is done, you can execute the whole pipeline (with just one stage) using the <code>dvc repro</code> command. If everything went OK, you should find a new dataset in the <code>data/initial_features/</code> directory with the selected variables.</p>
<p>You will realize DVC has created a new file ẁith name <code>dvc.lock</code>. The file <code>dvc.lock</code> contains the information about the recently created files. This file should be added to your git repository. The <code>dvc.lock</code> file will provide the necessary information for retrieving all the files in remote storage.</p>
<p>So now is the time to do a <code>dvc push</code> one more time to store the newly generated dataset in the remote storage. Notice that you don’t need to use <code>dvc add</code> in this case. The <code>dvc.lock</code> file has the information. However, don’t forget to commit the <code>dvc.lock</code> and pushed it to your remote git repository. The whole process is illustrated in the animation shown below.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="images/dvc-example-2-02.gif" width="1401" /></p>
<p>If you are lucky, you should have configured and successfully run the first pipeline stage. In the next post, I will discuss other useful features of DVC such as metrics and experiments, as well as some limitations I found. Just stay tuned!!<br />
