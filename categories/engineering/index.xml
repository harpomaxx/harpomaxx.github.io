				Notebooks rule! We agree on that, but they can get messy very fast. The truth is  they are not the best tool for good software engineering practices. Data Version Control (DVC) is a toolset for helping the development of machine learning experiments favoring better practices. Are you ready to give it a try? [5min read]

				Decent programming skills, strong math and stats knowledge, and amazing visuals are not enough for a data science position in the industry. These are just  necessary tools you will need for doing your daily tasks, but you don&#39;t have to lose the ultimate goal &#34;to  provide valuable information to decision-makers&#34; (Duh!).  This is how you can make a difference and companies know it. [5min read]

				Working with machine learning is not what it used to be. Let&#39;s face it. Now, there is much less time for hacking and much more time for deployment. The situation is not new and certainly not bad at all. That is why you should be prepared for the new roles and positions offered by the market. [5min read] (updated 04/09/2021)
