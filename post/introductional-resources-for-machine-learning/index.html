<p>From time to time, people ask me about recommended resources for starting with Machine Learning. The fact is that there are a lot of right places with plenty of help. So many places that you need some guide to finding the right one for you. Recently, I read a twitter post about <a href="https://twitter.com/schmidhuberai?lang=en">Jurgen Schimdhuber</a> (known for his work on <a href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">LSTM</a>) recommended reading to new members of his labs. At <a href="https://labsin.org">LASBIN</a>, we also have a modest reading list for new members and interns. I decided to publish a portion of the material we recommend to our new members.</p>
<div id="first-aproximation-to-machine-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>First aproximation to Machine Learning</h3>
<p>You have an MS Excel background and need to start with essential Machine Learning topics.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use <a href="https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a>. A well-known data mining/machine learning tool from WAIKATO University. Old, algorithms are somewhat outdated, but it still gets the work done if you need something easy to start.</li>
<li>The book <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123748560/data-mining-practical-machine-learning-tools-and-techniques">Data Mining, Practical Machine Learning Tools, and Techniques</a>. The people behind WEKA wrote a book about the framework. They included an excellent introduction to Machine Learning Topics. We recommend reading chapters 1 to 4. There, you will find a snapshot of the most common algorithms and machine learning techniques. Also, the book includes a series of chapters describing WEKA. So you can give it a try to them if you want to.</li>
<li><a href="https://rapidminer.com/products/studio/">Rapidminer Studio</a>. If you feel comfortable with your WEKA skills, then you can give Rapidminer Studio a try. Rapidminer Studio has some similarities with WEKA, but it is has grown to become a potent tool for designing your machine learning workflow.</li>
<li>In 2017, I gave a talk about Data Science. Most of the concepts were stolen from the book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-for/9781449374273/">Data Science for Busines</a>. Videos of the talk are available on youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/rNDwXp2OHp8">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/2Zrk4H43J0k">Part 2</a> (in Spanish).</li>

<div id="you-want-to-be-proficient-with-machine-learning" class="section level3">
<h3>You want to Be Proficient with Machine Learning</h3>
<p>You have a decent level in some high-level programming language (Matlab, R)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Andrew NGâ€™s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Introduction to Machine Learning course</a>. Today is a mandatory introduction course if you want to get proficient with machine learning. We recommend the first 6 weeks. You can avoid the topics about Linear Algebra and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> (An open-source MatLab) if you already have knowledge about them.</p></li>
<li><p>The Book <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</a> provides a very practical introduction to several machine learning topics. The book also includes examples in R language. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 cover the basics of regression and classification problems. Chapter 5 is very important since it provides information about model evaluation using resampling techniques. Finally, chapter 8 is also a mandatory one, since it provides an introduction to tree-based algorithms. (Bagging and Boosting approaches).</p></li>
<li><p>The book <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">Data Science for R</a> is a very useful resource if you want to be proficient in R. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 7 have a very excellent introduction to essential topics such as visualization and data mangling.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pmddomingos">Pedro Domingoâ€™s</a> article <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay122/cacm12.pdf">A few useful things to know about machine learning</a> is an article straightforward to read with some handy tips when applying machine learning to different problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The book <a href="http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/">Applied Predictive Modeling</a> from Max Kuhn (the creator of the <a href="https://github.com/topepo/caret">R caret package</a>). This book is highly recommended. I would say that the whole book should be read. Sorry ðŸ˜›</p></li>

<div id="you-want-to-get-serious-with-machine-learning." class="section level3">
<h3>You want to Get Serious with Machine Learning.</h3>
<p>You are interested in the statistical and mathematical roots of Machine Learning.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/prml-book/">Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a> is one of the most recognized books on the machine learning field. It provides a detailed theoretical explanation behind all the concepts applied in machine learning algorithms. The first 4 chapters are mandatory for anybody wanting to get serious with Machine learning. I would say that the book is something you should always need to have in your shelf for reference. Chapter 11 gives a very good introduction to sampling strategies.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> is another classical book on the topic with a statistical perspective. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/">Trevor Hastie</a>, and <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/">Robert Tibshirani</a> are among the authors of the books. Chapters 7, 8 9, and 10 are a must-read and certainly you will be revisiting them from time to time. Besides, chapter 5 discusses the expansion to linear regressor/classifier</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/">Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence and Data Science</a> is a relatively new book from Trevor Hastie. The idea of the book is to revisit several machine learning and statistical concepts adapted to the big data era.</p></li>
