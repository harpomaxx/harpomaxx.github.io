				The idea of making art with code is not new, but what about Data? Can data be a work of art?  Well, the truth is that thanks to  conceptualism, it is possible. Trust me! [4min read]

				Notebooks rule! We agree on that, but they can get messy very fast. The truth is  they are not the best tool for good software engineering practices. Data Version Control (DVC) is a toolset for helping the development of machine learning experiments favoring better practices. Are you ready to give it a try? [5min read]

			<title>SHAP values with examples applied to a multi-classification problem.</title>

				We can not continue treating our models as black boxes anymore. Remember, nobody trusts computers for making a very important decision (yet!). That&#39;s why the interpretation of  Machine Learning models has become a major research topic. SHAP is a very robust approach for providing interpretability to any machine learning model.  For multi-classification problems, however, documentation and examples are not very clear. [8min read]
