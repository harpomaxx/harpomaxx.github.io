				Notebooks rule! We agree on that, but they can get messy very fast. The truth is  they are not the best tool for good software engineering practices. Data Version Control (DVC) is a toolset for helping the development of machine learning experiments favoring better practices. Are you ready to give it a try? [5min read]

These are just  necessary tools you will need for doing your daily tasks, but you don&#39;t have to lose the ultimate goal &#34;to  provide valuable information to decision-makers&#34; (Duh!).  This is how you can make a difference and companies know it. [5min read]
