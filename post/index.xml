				Feature selection is a topic any machine learning practicioner should master. There are plenty strategies for performing feature selection. Some more useful than others. Some with more limitation than benefits.  Here, I mention the most common approaches for feature selection using information collected from articles, books and research papers. [5 min read]

				From time to time you will need to compare the distribution of two datasets. There are plenty of information about this topic in statistics books and all over the Internet. In this post I discuss three very practical approaches coming from different perspectives. [3.5 min read]

				The usual approach of shuffling the data and split in train and test could not be the best strategy for some cases for getting a good error estimator  of your model. Sometimes pure random splits do not guarantee the required level of dissimilarity. In adition, all the precautions to avoid contamination of your test set during your trainset manipulation must be taken for the test fold during cross validation. [4min read]

				Experimental Design in Machine learning is well established. However, from time to time it is important to revisit the process to analyze the  confidence level you have in your results. Machine learning shares a lot with statistics, but since Machine learning practitioners have a more practical vision, sometimes the experimental design is neglected when applied to real-world problems. This note explains the basic strategy followed in almost any machine learning experimental setup.

			<title>Are Boosting Algorithms the new baseline model for your Tabular data? Part 1</title>

				Neural networks rule the world of machine learning IFF, you have a lot of data, and just for a reduced set of problems. The fact is that for heterogeneous (numerical and categorical) tabular data, decision trees are still one of the best options. Also, they have the benefit of being (more) explainable to the customer. Boosting decision trees are among the most successful algorithms in data science competitions, but could they replace Random Forest? The absolute leader, when you try a first model in your data.[updated]

				Jupyter and Rstudio notebooks have become the default standard for data science development. However, it is important to know their limitations and detect the moment of moving to a more &#34;powerful&#34; tool. Since in data science a very significant portion of the work is related to  development, it is always important to be aware of the last development tools.

				The U-shape observed when measuring model performance on testset as a function of its flexibility does not hold during training deep learning models. (WHAT!!!?????. Is the world going mad?. Not really.)

				Beware of Random Forest GINI index for feature importance. Some other resources related with feature selection such as how to use PCA and the problems (or not) behind colinearity.
