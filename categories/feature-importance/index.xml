				We can not continue treating our models as black boxes anymore. Remember, nobody trusts computers for making a very important decision (yet!). That&#39;s by the prediction of a Machine Learning model has become a major research topic. SHAP is a very nice approach for providing interpretability to any machine learning model.  For multi-classification problems, however, documentation and examples are not very clear. [8min read]
